==========================================
VPC KEY POINTS TO REMEMBER
==========================================

=> VPC is Regional. We can create maximum 5 VPC's per region.

=> AWS by default provides a Default VPC for every region.

=> Basic VPC Setup Order:
		1. Create VPC
		2. Internet Gateway
		3. Public and Private Subnets
		4. NAT Gateway
		5. Route Tables

=> Internet Gateway provides internet access to VPC resources.

=> Public Subnet -> Which is exposed to the Internet.
				 ->	Public Subnet traffic is routed to Internet Gateway. 

=> NAT Gateway (Network Address Translator)

=> Private Subnet -> Which is not exposed to the Internet.
				  -> Private Subnet traffic is routed to NAT Gateway.
				  -> NAT Gateway then routes traffic to the Internet Gateway.

=> NAT Gateway should be placed in a Public Subnet.
	WHY? -> Because NAT Gateways needs direct access to Internet to forward traffic
			from Private Subnet to the internet.

=> NAT Gateway translates the Private IP to its own Public IP (Elastic IP) before sending traffic to the internet.

-----------
ROUTE TABLE 
-----------
-> A route table is a set of rules, or "routes," that determine how network traffic from a subnet is directed to a specific destination, such as another subnet, an Internet Gateway, or a virtual private gateway.

=> Route Table Controls outbound traffic (where traffic goes).

=> Security Group + NACL	Controls inbound traffic (who is allowed to come in).

=> Public Route Table is associated to a Public Subnet.

=> Private Route Table is associated to a Private Subnet.

-----------------------------
BASTION SERVER/ JUMP SERVER)
-----------------------------

=> One Subnet can be associated in One Availability Zone at the same time.

=> One Availability Zone can have Multiple Subnets.

=> Subnet Mask decides how many IP Addresses you can get inside Subnet.

FORMULA -> [ 2^32-n ]
----------------------
for example ->   Given: 192.168.1.0/24
				 Formula: 2^32-n
				 Solution: 2^32-24 = 2^8 = 256
				 Answer: You will get total 256 IP Addresses within that Subnet. 
	
	Important: Every Subnet has 5 IP Adresses are reserved.
			   1) .0 -> Network Related
			   2) .1 -> Routing Purpose
			   3) .2 -> DNS Purpose
			   4) .3 -> Future Purpose
			   5) .255 -> Broadcasting Purpose
          =>  Above IP Addresses are reserved and you cannot assign.
